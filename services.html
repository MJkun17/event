                                                    into society. In many ways, it's the second most important event in a young lady's
                                                     life, after her wedding. Of course, in the past, the debut served as a formal 
                                                     opportunity for a young woman to meet the sons of wealthy or influential families
                                                      in order to discuss marriage prospects. Fortunately, today's young women have

                                                          and friends to show their love for her by offering advice, guidance, and
